From the tester's point of view the following requirements are important:

### **Functional requirements**:

1. KONTRA is customised by different products, so the tester gets new, or modified product versions and will (re-)execute prebuild tests in order to see impacts on stability and performance of the product
2. The test environment will be used by a tester going to test functional and performance business aspects of KONTRA
3. The tester will file the test results (e.g. purpose of the test) and the test environment enriches the test results by date of execution, tester, etc.
4. The tester will extend, modify the test case suite
5. Test environment can be used by a user w/o knowing:
  1. the system under test (KONTRA, database, etc.)
  2. how to install KONTRA, database, etc.

### **Non-functional requirements:**

1. No dependency to local installations, but **using docker** instead
  1. no locally installed databases (DB2, Oracle, etc.)
  2. database connetcion easy to replace by a connection to an existing database (remote/local)
  3. build process (maven) w/o local dependencies using docker
  4. setup of database w/o local tools but database tools/clients using docker
2. One easy installation and test execution procedure using a **git project** and **docker-compose** to deploy, install and execute the test
3. **Test results stored in repository** (e.g. git)
4. Test results are analysed and accumulated centralized (e.g. mysql in the cloud)
5. **Good documentation** to repeat the setup w/o using docker but **execute the** **steps manually**

### **Prelimitations:**

1. Docker installed
2. git installed

### **Delimitations**

1. The user can compare the test results to older results but this is not part of the core test environment
2. The documentation does not describe the docker installation
3. The documentation does not describe the git installation
